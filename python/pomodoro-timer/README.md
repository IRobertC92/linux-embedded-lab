## üß† How It Works
- The timer cycles through the following sequence automatically:

- Work (25 min)
- Short Break (5 min)
- Work (25 min)
- Short Break (5 min)
- Work (25 min)
- Short Break (5 min)
- Work (25 min)
- Long Break (20 min)

- After the long break, the cycle restarts.
- Each completed work session adds a ‚úì mark under the timer.

---

## üîî Sound Notifications
- If you run with --sound:
- On Windows, it uses the winsound.Beep() function.
- On macOS/Linux, it triggers the system bell (\a).
- You can easily replace the play_sound() function in the script with another sound method (e.g., playsound or pygame.mixer) if you want custom audio.
